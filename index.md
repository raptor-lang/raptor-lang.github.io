# RaptorScript Documentation
RaptorScript is a programming language written as an educational exercise by Topisani and Vel0cityX. It consists of a compiler and a bytecode interpreter. This page contains docs for both tools, along with a basic language specification.

## The language itself

RaptorScript's Syntax is aimed at being intuitive to write, while not necessarily sticking to convention. This is a balance we are always working towards.

The language borrows syntax, as it does with features, from a lot of different places. Notable mentions would be Rust and Scala, along with Python.

Many of these points will have a few options, as we are still deciding on which
one of them to go with.
